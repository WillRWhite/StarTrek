### Release tag naming convention     

#### Pre-Release (beta release)  
0.mn   
1.mn  
2.mn  
..  
....  
where mn goes from 00, 01, 02 .... 99  

#### Release 
1.n  
2.n  
..  
...  
m.n
where m goes from 0 to 99 and n from 0 to 9  

So for example if the last pre-release was 2.36 and you wish to make this an actual release then it will be taged as 2.4. The next pre-release would then be 2.41. If the pre-releases get as far as 2.49 then the next pre-release will be 2.50, so an actual release of 2.5 would never exist.
